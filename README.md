# Chinese Travel App

## 🎯 Overview
A mobile application that allows users to capture, translate, and log Chinese names and locations to reduce language barriers.

### Motivation
When going back to China, I went to a lot of places but could not name where I went due to not knowing how to read Chinese, along with the address.
This is to make it easier for me to log where I have been by simply taking a picture of the Chinese name of each place I've been to, using the metadata to extract the whereabouts as well.
